# Slab Allocator Simulation
## Why?

This slab allocator solves several key memory management problems in C/C++ programming:

- **Reduces memory fragmentation**: By allocating memory in fixed-size blocks (slabs), it minimizes fragmentation.
  
- **Improves allocation and deallocation efficiency**: The allocator uses separate lists for allocated and free objects, reducing overhead and speeding up allocation and deallocation.

- **Allows for better tracking of memory usage**: Slab allocators track the number of allocated and free objects, providing real-time insights into memory usage.

- **Optimizes small object allocations**: Particularly beneficial in systems programming or embedded systems where small, frequent allocations are common.

By using the slab allocator, developers can implement a more efficient memory management system, especially in environments where performance and memory usage are critical.
## What?
## Slab Allocator in Kernel Module

A **slab allocator** in kernel modules is a memory management system used by the kernel to efficiently allocate and deallocate memory for objects of fixed sizes. It organizes memory into pre-allocated blocks called **slabs**, which are subdivided into **caches** to store objects of a specific size. This method reduces fragmentation and improves the performance of memory operations in the kernel.

### Key Features:
- **Object Caching**: Memory is allocated in slabs, which are divided into caches that hold objects of a fixed size.
- **Minimized Fragmentation**: Reduces both internal and external fragmentation by allocating memory in fixed-size chunks.
- **Efficient Allocation/Deallocation**: Allocates objects quickly from the free list in a slab and reuses memory, reducing overhead.
- **Multiple Object Sizes**: Supports different object sizes through separate caches for each type of object.
- **Cache Reuse**: Slabs and caches are reused to optimize memory management and prevent wastage.
